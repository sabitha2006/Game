## ðŸ“„ **Project Description: Hangman Game in Python**

The **Hangman Game** is a classic word-guessing game developed using Python. In this project, the player must guess the hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of wrong attempts allowed. It uses basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, and string operations â€” making it a great beginner-friendly Python project.

### ðŸ”§ **Key Features**:

* Random word selection from a predefined word list
* Hints provided for each word
* Visual representation of the hangman with each wrong guess
* Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Tracks playerâ€™s correct and incorrect guesses
* Text-based UI that runs in any Python shell or terminal

### ðŸ’¡ **Learning Outcomes**:

* Use of control flow (`if`, `while`, `for`)
* Handling user input and validation
* Working with strings and lists
* Implementing game logic and replay features
* Adding enhancements like hints and scoring

This project is a great way to strengthen core Python skills and have fun while building a playable console game
